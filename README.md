# CS104_Assignments_template 

## Why this repo?

- This is a slightly revised template from the origin repo **[SUSTech_hw_template](https://github.com/zhuhu00/SUSTech_hw_template)** and it'll be mainly applied in my 2024 Spring Course ***Introduction to Mathematical Logic*** which recommends $\LaTeX$ form in assignments.

- Other templates of $\LaTeX$ SUSTech：[https://github.com/SUSTC/latex-template](https://github.com/SUSTC/latex-template)

<!--Thanks to them for the their functionalizing class file.
    And I hope to provide a trivial convenience for someone who find this repo.-->

## Others
